    "The three stages of building a model in machine learning are data preprocessing, model building, and model evaluation. Data preprocessing involves preparing the data by handling missing values, feature selection, normalization, and splitting into training and testing sets. Model building involves choosing an appropriate algorithm, training the model on the training data, and fine-tuning its parameters. Model evaluation involves assessing the model's performance on the testing data to measure its accuracy and effectiveness."
